# Team Waterloop

Canada's Hyperloop, designed and built at the University of Waterloo.
This is the documentation hub for all components of our pod.

This site is not intended for sharing outside of the team.

## Adding documentation

- `git clone https://github.com/teamwaterloop/docs`

- Edit the relevant files in the `docs` folder. Files are written in 
    [Markdown](http://commonmark.org/help/), with a couple of 
    [extensions](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#markdown-extensions).

- Modify the navigation bar in `mkdocs.yml` as necessary.

- `git commit -m "<a brief descriptive message about what you added>"`

- `git push origin master`

After pushing, the updated documentation will be compiled and deployed to 
[docs.teamwaterloop.ca](https://docs.teamwaterloop.ca) within a couple of minutes.

## Building locally
